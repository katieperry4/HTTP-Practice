## Description
I used a dummy website that allows you to fetch data and attached that data to the DOM. I retrieved a list of user objects, filtered out their first names, and attached it to the user list. I also made it so you can add your name to the user list. I posted the user's input to the server but since it's a dummy server it doesn't save my post request.
 
## Technology

HTML, 
CSS, 
Vanilla JS

## Roadmap

In the future, I need to add some CSS to make it look better and add some more functionalities.
